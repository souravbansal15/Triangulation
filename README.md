# Triangulation
## employs Hashing with Separate Chaining
This project is part of Assignments under the course Data Structures and Algorithms at IIT Delhi.
3-D shapes can be approximated using Triangles on their surfaces. This basically forms a Graph Structure with Triangles and nodes and Triangles with Common edges as Neighbours.
This Programs answers various queries employing efficient algorithms which makes it fast on queries amounting to even a Million entries of triangles.
